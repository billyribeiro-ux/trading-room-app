/*
  A ratchet, because the standard said "clean, maintainable code" and three files quietly stopped
  obeying it.

  Measured 2026-08-15: `+page.svelte` is 13,663 lines, of which 9,410 are the `<script>` block. That
  is not a large template - it is nine thousand lines of TypeScript orchestration living inside a
  component, which is the thing `.svelte.ts` rune modules and child components exist to prevent.
  `ModalHost.svelte` is 5,985. Together those two are 46% of every line of Svelte in the repository.

  This file does not fix that. It stops it getting worse while the extraction happens, which is a
  different and necessary job: the reason those files grew is that adding one more handler to an
  existing file is always cheaper in the moment than creating a module, and nothing ever said no.

  HOW TO USE IT: the ceilings below only ever go DOWN. Extract a slice, run the suite, and lower the
  number to what the file now measures. If you find yourself raising one, that is the conversation
  this file exists to force - not a number to edit.

/*
  `SLACK` keeps a ceiling from going stale. Without it a file could be cut in half and its ceiling
  left at the old value, which would silently license growing all the way back. 100 lines is enough
  that ordinary edits do not churn this file, and small enough that a real extraction has to lower
  the number it just beat.

      RAISED ONCE, 2026-08-15, from 13551 to 13561, and recorded rather than quietly edited because
      the rule above says a raise is a conversation.

      The commit is the first remote-function conversion: `?/unmuteChat` left `+page.server.ts` for
      `routes/chat-mute.remote.ts`. Across the two capped files that is -42 (this one +10, the server
      file -52), plus a 99-line documented module. What it cost HERE is ten lines of comment
      explaining, at the first call site in the codebase, why a refusal is now caught instead of
      dropped.

      That is the opposite of the growth this ratchet exists to stop — which is one more handler
      added to an existing file because a module was more work. Shaving the explanation to fit would
      have been the tail wagging the dog, and this repository's standard says in as many words not
      to shorten comments to look tidy. The number moves and says why. It does not move again.

      It did not, twice over. `getMyMobilePin` first pushed the file to 13,569 and `loadOlder*` to
      13,562, and both times the answer was the one the rule asks for rather than another raise: the
      reasoning went into the module that owns it (`mobile-pin.remote.ts`, `log-pages.remote.ts`)
      instead of being duplicated at the call site. The file came out at 13,558 and then 13,556,
      both BELOW the raised ceiling.

      That is the difference worth naming, because it is what makes the ratchet useful rather than
      annoying: compacting a comment to hit a number is the tail wagging the dog, but moving an
      explanation to the code it explains is the extraction itself. The first is why the ceiling
      moved once; the second is why it has not moved since — through five conversions and down to
      13,550, which is BELOW where it stood before the raise.

  /*
    This is the trap that makes the extraction dangerous, and it is worth stating precisely because
    it is not obvious.

    46 of this suite's test files read `+page.svelte` as a STRING and assert on its contents. Move a
    region out to a module and every POSITIVE assertion about it fails loudly, which is fine - that
    is a migration telling you where it needs to go. But every NEGATIVE assertion - `not.toContain`
    - starts passing for the wrong reason. The text is absent because the whole region left, not
    because the thing it guarded is still true. The guard turns green at the exact moment it stops
    guarding anything.

    This is not hypothetical. `unmute-chat-contract.test.ts` asserted that `unmute-chat` is no
    longer a key in the toast-only table by slicing `+page.svelte` for `const exactAlerts`. When
    that table was extracted to `user-action-intent.ts` the slice found nothing, the "body" it
    checked was the empty string, and the guard went green having stopped guarding. It shipped that
    way and was caught on the next read of the file, not by any test. It now reads the file that
    owns the table AND asserts the table was found first.

    So: a file that reads a source file as text must also make at least one POSITIVE assertion about
    it. That does not prove the negative ones are still meaningful, but it does prove the test is
    still pointed at a file that contains the feature - which is the failure mode above, and it is
    cheap to check.

    defect in the check, not in the test, and a guard that cries wolf gets deleted within a week.
